# About me
Hello there! I am Joel, I live in a small town in South West England with my wife (Ruth Clemence,
she blogs at https://ruthclemence.com) and my young son. By day I am a software engineer in the 
Civil Service, outside work I enjoy music and I am active in my local church.

Growing up I had two main passions, technology and music, two things that have persisted into my adulthood. I dabbled in
coding in school, nothing too serious and didn’t accomplish anything really. I then went off to university to study Computer
Science, here my life started, I met a great group of friends, most of whom I am still in contact with nearly 7 years since
leaving. When I wasn’t studying I was heavily involved in the Christian Union and my university church, I was playing lead
guitar, worship leading and for a period I headed up the flagship outreach activity ‘Tea and Toast’. During this period also
my faith exploded and I developed an intense desire to understand God more

Life is the sum of all our interests and experiences, this blog is the glimpse into the esoteric collections of thoughts from
me, I hope you get something from this
