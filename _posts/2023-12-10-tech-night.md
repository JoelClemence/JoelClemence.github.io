# This sunday night is Tech Night

This year has flown by! Indeed has time, I spent some time this evening
tinkering on my (now outdated) Raspberry Pi for the first time in a couple of
years. This has always been something I have wanted to do for long time, but
have always put off for many reasons. So long so that the OS on the RPI had
long since gone unsupported and so a reinstallation was in order. Thankfully a
relatively straightforward process.

This afternoon my wife decided to do a spruce up of her
[website](https://ruthclemence.com) when we decided to have a
Tech Night, the first of such in nearly ten years of marriage. For a techie
like me why didn't I suggest it sooner!?!

So tonight as well as dusting off my Raspberry Pi I have been doing some boring
Domain DNS admin stuff, which since setting up has gone awry. But now is fixed.

Not a lot more than that to show for our inaugrual Tech Night, perhaps some
more tech blogs in the future.
